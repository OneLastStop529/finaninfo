# finaninfo
This is a financial infomation web application that is based on springBoot and spring security.
I'm thinking about spiliting into two part of roles, users and admins. Admins can delete,update,add users ,news and affiche,
Much like the superuser.

Normal user can view News page edit his profile, and commenting under affiche.

Later on, I might add the stock graphing and other features like OAuth login
